For example, it turns out that viruses, despite their extraordinary prevalance, fail to meet many such criteria including the requirement for metabolism. More recently the discovery of mobile genetic elements militates for a more information theoretically grounded view of life not to mention a networked rather than hierarchical view of evolution and inheritance.

But there is of course no shortage of diversity amongst microbes. And indeed one way this diversity manifests is in the very ways in which microbes carry out the essential functions of life.",

        text: "Scientific revolutions often surprise us, in retrospect, not only by a dramatic transformation of our conception of nature but also by the intuition that the evidence for such a revolution lay in so shallow a setting that we might have stumbled upon it at any time. A recent study, with profound impacts, of a microbiological community less than ten metres from the surface of the earth, demonstrates that this can quite literally be the case. ",
